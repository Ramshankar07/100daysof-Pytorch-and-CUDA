# 100 Days of PyTorch and CUDA

Welcome to my journey through "100 Days of PyTorch and CUDA"! This repository is dedicated to improving my abilities and maintaining consistency in learning and optimizing with PyTorch and CUDA over the next 100 days. Each day, I'll tackle new concepts, implement algorithms, and share insights and progress.

## About the Challenge

The challenge is to spend each day learning or coding with PyTorch and CUDA, with the aim of deepening my understanding of these powerful tools for machine learning and parallel computing. The goal is not just to learn but to apply this knowledge in practical, real-world scenarios.

## Objectives

- **Master PyTorch:** Understand its core functionality, build neural networks, and learn how to train, test, and deploy models effectively.
- **Explore CUDA Optimization:** Learn how to leverage CUDA to optimize and accelerate computations in PyTorch models.
- **Daily Learning:** Dedicate time each day to learn or improve upon PyTorch and CUDA techniques.
- **Project Development:** Apply the learned concepts to develop meaningful projects that demonstrate the power of PyTorch and CUDA integration.

## Day-to-Day Progress

This section will log daily updates, thoughts, snippets, and significant breakthroughs. The format will include the day number, the topic covered, and a brief description of what was learned or developed.

Day 1: Introduction to PyTorch
Learned the basics of tensors in PyTorch and how they differ from NumPy arrays. Implemented simple tensor operations and explored PyTorch's dynamic computation graph.
